          <p class="line1">Hiring the right help to grow an early stage startup it’s always a tough decision. Having worked with so many businesses like yours and seen so many different needs, let me point you in the right direction.</p>
          <p class="line">Allow me to share with you a few <strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong> tips you should consider before hiring a freelance like me, an agency, or anyone (or anything...) else.</p>
          <span class="symbol">
            <p class="link"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>Tips you should consider before each project</p>
          </span>
          <!-- Tip #1 -->
          <h2>Tip #1 - Know your need/want</h2>
          <p>This might be something that sounds obvious but it’s not that simple and entrepreneurs tend to either not think enough about this or to over-think it.</p>
          <p>Ask yourself: what are your exact goals? In terms of growth, what do you want/need to accomplish? And when do you need that to happen?</p>
          <p>Don’t simply say you want your business to grow, because we all know that. ;)</p>
          <p>Clear goals narrow strategies. Narrowing strategies brings focus. Focus is the path for optimisation.</p>
          <!-- Tip #2 -->
          <h2>Tip #2 - Know your budget</h2>
          <p>This is always a sensitive subject but let me explain why we should openly talk about it.</p>
          <p>When dealing with growth, as you can imagine, we can easily come up with an infinite number of strategies.</p>
          <p>When an entrepreneur is ready to share the budget, we can adapt our action plan to that budget, as well as having it optimised for their ROI.</p>
          <p>It’s also great to manage everyone’s expectations and it makes the negotiations a lot smoother for everyone, without back and forth emails and proposals version #73.</p>
          <!-- Tip #3 -->
          <h2>Tip #3 - Know your deadlines</h2>
          <p>This is also something that is amazingly important and I am not only talking about it because of budgeting.</p>
          <p>Do you need a quick implementation for funding purposes? Do you have a product launch coming soon?</p>
          <p>Share your goals and deadlines as that would help creating the timeline for the project.</p>
          <p>By the way and I know this should be obvious but let me still say it: I see deadlines as what they are, deadlines. And I respect them a lot.</p>
          <!-- Tip #4 -->
          <h2>Tip #4 - Action without research</h2>
          <p>Hate to tell you this, but don’t accept working with anyone that won’t commit really hard to the research stage.</p>
          <p>This is where you’ll build the foundations for what comes next. And I am sure you want this investment to last, not to have to re-do it again in the near future because this one didn’t work, right?</p>
          <p>This is the most important stage of each project. Accessing what you have, what your market needs and what is saying about it as well as what your competitors are doing, is a great way to find the gaps to generate you value.</p>
          <p>And believe it or not, freelancers and agencies tend to say that they master your niche and immediately start producing content.</p>
          <p>Each project should be treated as a first one. There is no assumptions here.</p>
          <p>We work based on hard-work and research, not based on guessing.</p>
          <!-- Tip #5 -->
          <h2>Rule #5 - The only promise</h2>
          <p>I would love to simply tell you that we assure you immediate results.</p>
          <p>But I can’t.</p>
          <p>In fact, no one can. But a few still say it.</p>
          <p>When dealing with growth, marketing, in fact, when dealing with people, you can’t assure any type of results.</p>
          <p>The only promise we can make is hard work to remove as much “human randomness” as possible but we can never guarantee a specific result from a campaign.</p>
          <p>And this is why we test everything and are constantly building for optimisation.</p>
          <p>In fact, optimisation is what leads to the best results.</p>
          <p>And this is where we can safely say we are well above average in producing results.</p>
          <!-- Final Paragraph -->
          <h4 class="line1">Now that you have these in mind, why not contact me and share a bit of your current challenge and where exactly I could help you?</h4>
          <h4 class="line2">I’d be happy to take a look at your project and send you a quick rough with the next steps.</h4>
          <p class="ps1"><strong>P.S.</strong> By filling in the above form, you're not actually commiting to any sort of project. You're just sharing your challenge and I'll be sharing my opinion about it. It's 100% safe.</p>
          <p class="ps2"><strong>P.P.S.</strong> It's really important that we both understand if we would make a good fit or not. I am very picky with whom I work with and my availability doesn't stretch. The sooner we get to know each other, the better.</p>
