            <p class="bullet"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span><strong>Business growth passionate</strong> that knows how to drive more sales through better copy and better websites.</p>
            <p class="bullet"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span><strong>Freelancer that runs his business… well, as a business</strong>. And knows you’re running one too, so ROI and deadlines are mandatory.</p>
            <p class="bullet"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span><strong>Tech savvy</strong> that not only knows how to write words that lead to sales, but that also knows how to build powerful websites and web apps.</p>
          </span>

          <h2 class="headline2">Now, the not too long version…</h2>
          <p>Ever since I know myself that I’ve loved everything related with startups… the launch… the growth…</p>
          <p>I love the thrill, the stress, the uncertainty, the opportunity, the energy, the metrics, the dream…</p>
          <p>I’ve had the opportunity to run my own ad agency, the opportunity to launch a few brands and to define and implement their growth strategies.</p>
          <p>I was fortunate enough to work with some of the best creatives in the market. I even have a <strong>Cannes Lion</strong> in my portfolio with <a href="https://youtu.be/_ODFvy1mjoY?list=PLlvLekjrXBYJh4qr-uo-qOi9zUPenJuzO" target="_blank">this campaign</a> I managed for Microsoft.</p>
          <p>I’ve mentored some entrepreneurs and helped them launch their businesses as well as helped a few others getting the funding they needed.</p>
          <h4 class="head1">The experiment that worked</h4>
          <p>I am a reddit habitue. Can’t deny it.</p>
          <p>Why?</p>
          <p>Because it is a place where I can read people talking and where I can also engage in conversations about subjects I care.</p>
          <p>I can read their own words explaining something and I can read their feelings…</p>
          <p>A few years ago I made an experiment.</p>
          <p>I posted an offer on reddit.</p>
          <p>The title: “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1qpz8b/do_you_guys_need_any_help_with_your_startups/" target="_blank">Do you guys need any help with your startup?</a>”</p>
          <p>It was amazing.</p>
          <p>It was so great reddit <strong>offered me a full year as a gold member</strong>.</p>
          <p>And that was the first one. I’ve made a few others on reddit with similar success.</p>
          <p>I like to be informed. I like to understand what is happening but mostly, I like to be out there and hear what the market is saying as well as asking them the questions that really matters.</p>
          <h4 class="head2">And that is a great leverage my dear entrepreneur.</h4>
          <p>Want to know why?</p>
          <p>Let me very simply explain it to you.</p>
          <p>I am sure you did the first step. You validated your business and you have people buying your product your service.</p>
          <p>The market needs what you have to offer and you know it.</p>
          <p>But then, there is <strong>another very important thing</strong>.</p>
          <p>How to communicate what you have for them.</p>
          <p>And unless you use words that would sound as your market own words, people won’t really understand or connect with what you’re saying.</p>
          <p>Most likely, your startup won’t reach the <strong>full potential</strong> and you’ll be wasting a big opportunity. <strong>$$$ wise!!!</strong></p>
          <p class="space"><strong>And that is what I love doing...</strong></p>
          <span class="symbol">
            <p class="bullet2"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>Understanding businesses exactly like yours, dive into markets as complex as you can imagine, and really <strong>understand</strong> your potential costumer.</p>
            <p class="bullet2"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>After that, I’ll <strong>write words</strong> for websites and email campaigns that will speak directly to your customer heart and will whisper to their wallet.</p>
            <p class="bullet2"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>And in some cases I also code entire websites and desktop apps, where I combine my <strong>backend</strong> (Ruby and Ruby on Rails) and my <strong>Frontend</strong> (JavaScript, jQuery, Angular) knowledge.</p>
          </span>
          <p class="enough">But, enough talking about me.</p>
          <p class="cta">I would really love to know more about your startup and challenges you’re facing.</p>
