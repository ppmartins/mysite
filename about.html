          <span class="symbol">
            <p class="bullet"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span><strong>Business growth passionate</strong> that knows how to drive more sales through better copy and better websites.</p>
            <p class="bullet"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span><strong>Freelancer that runs his business… well, as a business</strong>. And knows you’re running one too, so ROI and deadlines are mandatory.</p>
            <p class="bullet"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span><strong>Tech savvy</strong> that not only knows how to write copy that lead to sales, but that also knows how to build powerful websites and web apps.</p>
          </span>

          <h2 class="headline2">Now, the not too long version…</h2>
          <p>Ever since I know myself that I’ve loved everything about new businesses.</p>
          <p>More specifically the <strong>launch</strong> and the <strong>growth</strong> stage.</p>
          <p>And to be honest, it’s not something I strategically picked as the subject to become an expert.</p>
          <p>I am here because I’ve been following my passion. Period.</p>
          <p>It’s the subject I am constantly reading about, it’s the topic of most of my conversations and it’s also what I love <a href="blog.html" target="_blank">writing about</a>.</p>
          <p>Mostly because I love the risk, the stress, the dream, the energy, the courage, the learning, the commitment, the excitement, the opportunity to make something great…</p>
          <p>I am sure this is not that far away from what you've experienced, right?</p>
          <h4 class="head1">My own startups</h4>
          <p>I know the feeling… to be able to help someone with something, it’s a plus to have been in that person's shoes before.</p>
          <p>Well, I’ve been there. More than once.</p>
          <p>I’ve had the opportunity to run my own ad agency, the opportunity to launch a few brands and to define and implement their growth strategies.</p>
          <p>I was fortunate enough to work with some of the best creatives in the market. I even have a <strong>Cannes Lion</strong> in my portfolio with <a href="https://youtu.be/_ODFvy1mjoY?list=PLlvLekjrXBYJh4qr-uo-qOi9zUPenJuzO" target="_blank">this campaign</a> I managed for Microsoft.</p>
          <p>I’ve mentored some entrepreneurs and helped them launch their businesses as well as helped a few others getting the funding they needed.</p>
          <h4 class="head2">What’s missing</h4>
          <p>When you work with startups, a fun factor, that is not that funny for most founders, is that there is always something missing.</p>
          <p>Sometimes we have the CTO, but we miss the CMO. Sometimes it's the other way around. Sometimes we need something else.</p>
          <p>And unless we can <strong>hire more and better people</strong>, most startups end up “limping” from one business department, if not more.</p>
          <p>And it’s normal. Sometimes even a bigger company has that same problem.</p>
          <p>And having worked with so many entrepreneurs and startups in the market, and reading about a lot more, it’s great to see how some entrepreneurs, like yourself, made it through this initial stage.</p>
          <h4 class="head2">The multidisciplinary help</h4>
          <p>Because I’ve lived that initial stage so many times, and saw the drawbacks and the initial barriers, I’ve ended up generating a strong curiosity about some important disciplines needed when growing a startup in today’s market.</p>
          <p>I too launched startups based in wordpress or squarespace templates. And there is <strong>no shame about it</strong>, right?</p>
          <p>But I also saw that sooner or later, to grow a business, we had to develop some digital strategies, sometimes involving building a <strong>new website</strong> or simply by providing the existing one with <strong>stronger copy, optimised for conversion and for SEO</strong>.</p>
          <p class="space"><strong>And that is where I’ve been helping businesses like yours, by</strong></p>
          <span class="symbol">
            <p class="bullet"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>Understanding your market to the deepest detail, because I am not in this to guess what your ideal customer might think, I am here to research about what he or she has to say about it.</p>
            <p class="bullet2"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>After that, I’ll <strong>write copy</strong> for websites and email campaigns that will speak directly to your customer heart and will whisper to their wallet.</p>
            <p class="bullet2"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>And in some cases I also code entire websites or landing pages, as well as desktop apps, where I combine my <strong>backend</strong> (Ruby and Ruby on Rails) and my <strong>Frontend</strong> (JavaScript, jQuery, Angular) knowledge.</p>
          </span>
          <p class="enough">But, enough talking about me.</p>
          <p class="cta">I would really love to know more about your startup and the challenges you’re facing.</p>
